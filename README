Spotify Duplicates scans a spotify playlist for duplicates according to filter and prints out the ones that match.
The playlist needs to be public and freely accessible over the internet. To run:

- Install any python dependencies:
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

- Set SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID and SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET in your environment. You get the values for these if you register an app in the spotify developers page.

- Make it executable (or else utilize python interpreter directly):
$ chmod +x dup.py

- Run it with the playlist ID and a regex filter as arguments. You get the ID through spotify client if you go for "spotify uri". 
The regex filter needs to match any kind of song key producing a series of groups. If two songs produce the exact identical groups they are considered duplicates. 
The key is of the form <song name>:<song artist>. If a playlist entry produces no groups it is ignored. Examples:

./dup.py <playlist_id> "(.+)"                                       # Get entries that have the exact same song and artist
./dup.py <playlist_id> "(.+):.*"                                    # Get entries that share only the same song
./dup.py <playlist_id> "([^-]+)(?: -.*(?:Remaster|Live).*)?:(.+)"   # Get entries that have same artist, and same song that may or may not be succeeded by " - Live..." or " - Remaster..."
